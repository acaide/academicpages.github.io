## Course Work:

### CS 109A: Intro to Data Science: https://github.com/acaide/CS109
Elementary data science course. The course focuses on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. The material of the course is divided 3 modules. Each module will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data:

1 - data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set;

2 - data management - accessing data quickly and reliably;

3 - exploratory data analysis - generating hypotheses and building intuition;

4 - prediction, statistical learning, and inference; and

5 - communication - summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. 



### E-63: Big Data Analytics https://github.com/acaide/E-63
The emphasis of this course is on mastering two most important big data technologies: Spark 2 and Deep Learning with TensorFlow. But more generally, this course was a survey aiming to familiarize students with the 'big data' technologies presently used in industry (hadoop, kafka, neo4j, casandra, spark, tensorflow, etc). Heavy emphasis on practical use/IT, cursory exploration on theory.
