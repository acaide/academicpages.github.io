CS 109A: Intro to Data Science: 

[Link to the full syllabus + Problem Sets](https://github.com/acaide/CS109)

_Abstract_: 
This course serves as a rigorous introduction to data science. 
The focus is on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. 
Material of the course is divided 3 modules, where each module will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data:

1. data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set;
2. data management - accessing data quickly and reliably;
3. exploratory data analysis - generating hypotheses and building intuition;
4. prediction, statistical learning, and inference; and
5. communication - summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.
