[Link to the Syllabus + Solutions](https://github.com/acaide/E63)

The emphasis of this course is on mastering two most important big data technologies: Spark 2 and Deep Learning with TensorFlow. 
More generally, this course was a survey aiming to familiarize students with the 'big data' technologies presently used in industry 
(hadoop, kafka, neo4j, casandra, spark, tensorflow, etc). 

Heavy emphasis on practical use/IT, cursory exploration on theory.
